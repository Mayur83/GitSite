// let keyword
// declare variable with let keyword

var firstName = "Mayur";
console.log(firstName);

// let was introduced in ES2015.
// before that, people used to use 'var'.
// var has limitations and that is why let was introduced.
// the main difference between let and var is block scope vs function scope, which will be discussed later.
